# Propertease

Propertease is a real estate management application built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **MySQL**.  
It provides a graphical interface for managing customers, properties, and agents, with all data securely stored in a relational MySQL database.

---

## Features

- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Manage Customer, Properties, and Agent tables
- MySQL database connectivity using `mysql.connector`
- Secure credential management using a `.env` file and `python-dotenv`
- Properly ignores sensitive files using `.gitignore`

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```

git clone https://github.com/Pradoshgopalkrishnan/propertease.git
cd propertease

```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```

pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv

```

Tkinter is usually installed with Python by default.

### 3. Set Up the MySQL Database

- Start your MySQL server.
- Create a new database, for example `propertease`.
- Import the provided SQL file to set up the initial schema:
```

mysql -u your_mysql_user -p < "PROPERTEASE BACKEND.sql"

```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (in the same folder as your code) containing your database credentials:

```

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASS=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=propertease

```

**NEVER share or commit your real `.env` file.**

### 5. Run the Application

```

python "SOURCE CODE.py"

```

---

## .gitignore Settings

Your `.gitignore` should include:

```

.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc

```

---

## Security and Collaboration

- Always keep your `.env` file private and out of version control.
- For sharing setup, provide a `.env.example` file (with placeholders, not real credentials).

---
